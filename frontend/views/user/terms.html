            <strong>DESCRIPTION:</strong>
            You are invited to participate in a research study on the “wisdom of crowds”, a phenomenon in which groups make better decisions than the constituent members. The purpose of this study is to understand the contexts in which groups effectively aggregate information. You will be asked to take an online quiz, consisting of questions on general knowledge, quantity estimation, spatial reasoning, and prediction. Some questions will involve audio and video content. We also will ask you for some demographic information so that we can accurately describe the general traits of the group of individuals who participate in the study. We will record your responses to all the questions you choose to answer.<br/>
            <br/>
            <strong>TIME INVOLVEMENT:</strong>
            Each quiz question takes approximately 30 seconds to answers, and you are free to answers as many or as few questions as you like. The entire quiz has over 1,000 questions.<br/>
            <br/>
